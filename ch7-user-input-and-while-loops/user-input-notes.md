# Ch 7 - User Input and While Loops

Key concepts of this chapter: <br>
 * Using the **input()** function
 * Setting flags - active, 'True' and 'False'
 * Practiced *while* loops 
 * *break* statement
 * Remembered to convert str values to int values for comparison
 * Removing instances from a list using **remove()**
 * Inserting user input into dictionaries 


 ## Reminders
 
 When populating a dictionary, I should remember to first define an empty one using curly brackets. <br>

 As I'm populating the dictionary, I make sure to use the format similar to an array-- **<dictionary_name>[key] = value**. I at first tried to use the append() function which didn't work. <br>

As usual, when printing the contents of the dictionary I need to remember to use the **items()** function. Without it, I'll always get a traceback error.
