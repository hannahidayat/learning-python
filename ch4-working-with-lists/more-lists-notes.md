# Chapter 3 - Lists continued 

Learning more about lists, I reviewed 
* Writing loops
* Using range() 
* List comprehensions 
* Slices
* Tuples 

## New things that I learned

* Copying lists is very easy by using name_list[:], colon noted
* Slicing can get confusing which index to use (second index is non-inclusive)
* Tuples are lists with items that cannot be altered by index, unless the entire tuple is updated with new values
* List comprehensions are hard to remember at first, but basically list = ["operation" "condition statement"]

## Overall
Lists are actually so fun to use with Python. Other than making sure I choose correct indices, it's easy to copy and access lists.
