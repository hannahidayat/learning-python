# Chapter 3 - Lists 

I learnt the basics of a list, along with the features
* sorted() 
* sort()
* remove()
* pop()
* append() 
* insert()
* del 
* reverse=True 
* len()

Accessing and manipulating a list is straightforward, although I did get sorted() and sort() confused for some of the practice.

<b>sorted()</b> is used by itself while *sort()* is a list method. It takes a bit to get used to the syntax. 

## What I learned that was new: 
- I can reverse lists by including reverse=True as an argument 
- I can access the last index of the list by [-1], then second-to-last, etc which is really useful 
- <b>sorted()</b> doesn't permanently change a list and is for printing to screen while *sort()* does 
- Easy to delete an item in the list by <b>del</b> name_list[index]

## Things I didn't understand 
I read that list items must be in lowercase in order to use *sort()*. It makes sense since 'a' and 'A' are interpreted differently, but I'd be curious as to what should be done with list items having mixed cases. I will assume for now that the list items must be all changed to lowercase.
